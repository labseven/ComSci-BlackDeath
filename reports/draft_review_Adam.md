# Draft Review Adam


## Question:
What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

The team is analyzing and extending Holm and Kim (HK) network creation. HK attempt to modify the BA model by adding a "triad formation" step to create higher clustering. I do not know what the "triad creation" step actually is, or why it models a social network better than BA.



## Methodology:
Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

The method for creating an HK graph is never explained. The method is hinted about in one paragraph, but I still do not know how to build an HK graph.

The extension methodology is also not explained. I know that they "modify [their] replication such that it is based on directed graphs." I do not know how that happens.
The second extension analyzes removing preferential attachment, but I do not know how the graph creation actually occurs.

## Results:
Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

I can read three tables, that effectively compare expected and real properties of their graphs. There is no explanation about what 'expected' means or where it comes from, but I can see that the numbers are similar. They also compare a PMF graph of the Facebook dataset and an HK graph, to show that it follows a power-law with similar distribution.

## Interpretation:
Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

The experiment is still in progress, so there is no interpretation in the report.

## Replication:
Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the

If I am reading the tables properly, their replication seems successful.

## Extension:
Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

The extensions are explained, but the explanations are lacking details of implementation.
The extension to implement the HK network for directional graphs seems like an interesting pursuit, but the report does not clearly explain how that will work.
The other extension, to explore how HK graphs behave without preferential attachment also seems interesting, but it does not go into detail about what specific question the analysis will answer.

## Progress:
Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

The team reports that replication is complete, and that the extensions are also complete. They are missing analysis of their extension, which seems to be about where most teams are right now.

## Presentation:
Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?

Overall, the draft is clearly a draft. The language and layout are good, but there is still substantial content and editing missing. I did not find any major style guide violations, short of a few loose words.

## Mechanics:
Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?

Everything looks good.
